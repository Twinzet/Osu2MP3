# Osu2MP3 (GITHUB REPO IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)

Have you ever missed your Osu songs when you aren't playing Osu? Of course you can find and download your songs from the internet, but when your Osu songs collection has more than 1000 songs, it isn't the best idea to try to download them all manually.

The good thing is that all of your beatmaps have an MP3 version of their songs nested in your Osu installation. Unfortunately these MP3 files are nested within individual folders, not in one big list that can be accessed easily. On top of that, the MP3 files are not named using their beatmap name with most of them being simply named 'audio.mp3', which means that you can't really file explorer's built-in parser to pull all of the MP3 files.

_As you can see this method is not very helpful_ 


## **The Solution**

I have made a program that allows you to do exactly that. Finding, renaming and transferring all of your Osu beatmap MP3s to your folder of choice, giving you a location with all of your songs in one place. To use, put the path of the folder titled "Songs" (located inside the files of your Osu! installation) in the first path selector, then put the path to the folder that you want the MP3s to be copied to in the second path selector. Hit start and the your songs will be copied.

Enjoy!
